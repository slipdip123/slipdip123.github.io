layout: post
title: Jekyll-Poster

I have made a tool that creates a post for Jekyll based blogs. It is written in python and lets you create posts by asking for the date, the title and the content. It automatically adds the layout: post and title: (inputted by user). My next addition will be to be able to use text files as input and (maybe) to change formatting to markdown (not likely). Check it out [here](https://github.com/slipdip123/Jekyll-Poster)
